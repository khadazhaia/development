Exercise

Write some code that takes in numbers from a user one at a time. This should keep going until the user enters 0. Then print the sum of all the numbers.
If the user inputs something that isn't a number, an error message should appear and the program should stop. (Hint: use break)

Example (no error):
5
12
0
Sum: 17

Example (error):
5
7
c
Error: Not a number

'''
    
'''Declare any needed variables'''

# userinput, sum = " ", 0

# ''' Start our loop '''
# while True:
#    ''' Get user input'''
#    userinput = input("Please enter your number: ")

#    ''' Test for letter '''
#    if userinput.isalpha():
#       print("Error: Not a number")
#       break
#    ''' covert to integer, end and print sum if zero, otherwise continue to add to sum '''
#    userinput = int(userinput) # recast to integer

''' Continue keyword '''

''' Example
Use the continue keyword to loop through a string and only print the vowels.

# Option 1 # This method can be used to look for taken usernames
# test_string = "hello"
# # vowels = "aeiou"
# vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]

# for t in test_string:
#    if t in vowels:

# Option 2

# test_string = "hello"

# for t in test_string:

#       print(t)
#    else:

Exercise:
Sum of Even Digits

Take a string as user input, and verify that it's a number.
Loop through each digit of the number, and only add it to the sum if it's even.
Print the sum of all the even digits at the end. 
Make sure to use the continue keyword.

Exercise

Write some code that takes in strings from a user one at a time.
After each string is taken in evaluate if the string is empty, a number, a set of letters, or contains symbols.
If the string is empty, stop the loop.
If the string is a number, convert it to a float and add it to a total.
If the string is a set of letters, concatenate to the other letter strings passed in.
If it contains a symbol, or is none of the above, do nothing and repeat the loop.
Make sure to use break and/or continue.
