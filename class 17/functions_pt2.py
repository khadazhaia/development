Exercise
Write a function called center that returns either the mean or median of a list of numbers.
This function should take two parameters: A list of numbers, and an optional parameter called use_median which should default to False.
If use_median is False, return the mean of the list.
If use_median is True, return the median of the list.
Test your function by calling it with different arguments.

Exercise
Write a Python function called get_stats that takes in a list of numbers and returns the following three values: The mean, the median, and the mode of the list.
Call the function on a list, and print each statistic on a separate line.
my_list = [1,2,4,5,5]
Output:
Mean: 3.4
Median: 4
Mode: 5

A lambda is a small anonymous function. It can take any number of arguments, but it can only have one expression, which is returned.
Syntax: lambda arguments : expression

Exercise
Write a lambda that computes the n-th power of a number, given two arguments, num and n.
Now, write a function that is equivalent to the lambda.

''' Higher Order Functions
These are functions that may accept a function as an argument or return a function as its output. In Python, reduce(), map() and filter() are some of the most important higher-order functions. When combined with simpler functions, they can be used to execute complex operations.

filter - The filter() method filters the given sequence with the help of a function that tests each element in the sequence to be true or not. 

map - returns a map object(which is an iterator) of the results after applying the given function to each item of a given iterable (list, tuple etc.)

# Let's use the filter function to find the even numbers in a list

Assignment 6
Write a simple function that returns a person's net worth. Here are your requirements:
Docstring which includes what function does and information on your parameters (brief)
Function name - net_worth
parameters - assets, liabilities
Must contain type hinting for the parameters as well as what the function will be returning
Call the function in a print statement with needed arguments
