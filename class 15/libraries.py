Example
Import the math library.
Take the radius of a circle as user input.
Then, compute the area of the circle using the math library.
'''
# radius = int(input("What is the radius? "))
# area = math.pi * radius**2
# print(area)

# BONUS
# lets do a try except just in case the user enters letters
# try:
#   radius = int(input("What is the radius? "))
#   area = math.pi * radius**2
#   print(area)
# except ValueError:
#   print("Invalid input, numbers only")

Exercise
Lets make some magic happen with the statistics library.

# With Statistics Library

''' Nice little mean calculator to help with our testing

This website provides free api testing. Lets leverage python's request module to see if we can do a get request against this data
