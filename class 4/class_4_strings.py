Exercise 

Write some code that takes a string from the user, and prints how many vowels are in the string. (Vowels are a, e, i, o, u)
How will you count both uppercase and lowercase vowels?
What string method can you use to count the number of vowels?

Example
User input: Computer
3

'''



'''
You have a variable called hours which equals 24, the number of hours in a day.
Print There are 24 hours in a day. Make sure to use your variable.
First, print using commas. Remember that using commas automatically adds spaces!
Now, print using string concatenation. Remember to cast hours to a string and manually add the spaces!

'''


'''
Write some code that will print a box around a string.
