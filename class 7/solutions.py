You have a variable called hours which equals 24, the number of hours in a day.
Print There are 24 hours in a day. Make sure to use your variable.
First, print using commas. Remember that using commas automatically adds spaces!
Now, print using string concatenation. Remember to cast hours to a string and manually add the spaces!
'''

hours = 24
# print("There are", hours, "hours in a day.")
# print("There are " + str(hours) + " hours in a day") #concatenation
# print(f"There are {hours} hours in a day.") # f-string or formatted string

You need to write a script that will generate an email to a customer who has just made a purchase. You have 3 variables:
name, which stores the customer's name as a string
product, which stores the product name as a string
price, which stores the price of the product as a float
Use an f-string to generate an email message with the following text, and print it. Make sure to round the price to 2 decimal places. The email should be one multi-line string.
Dear {name},
Thank you for your purchase of a {product}. Your credit card has been charged ${price}.
We appreciate your business and look forward to serving you again.
Sincerely,
The ABC Company

Write some code that takes a string and tells if it is a palindrome (same forwards and backwards).
Hint: Use indexing/slicing and boolean expressions

Examples:
racecar: True
cat: False
'''

word = "cat"

# testing for palindrome
# reversed_word = word[::-1]

# if word == reversed_word:
#     print("Congrats you have a palindrome")
# else:
#     print("Sorry, not a palindrome.")
