# Assign meaningful variable names 
side_one = 5
base = 6
side_two = 10

# The formula for a perimeter of a triangle p = a + b + c
perimeter = side_one + base + side_two

# Output a print statement, "The perimeter of your triangle is...
print("The perimeter of your triangle is", perimeter)

# Output a print statement, "Is side 1 greater than side 2?          
print(side_one > side_two)

# Output a print statement, "Is the base equal to side 1?
print(base == side_two)
