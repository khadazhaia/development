'''
I am a multi-line comment and 
can easily be used to span 
multiple lines in a Python file
'''

"""
You can also use the double quotes
to create as a multi-line comment.
Anything in between these three quotes will not run

'''
Comments that contradict the code are worse than no comments. Always make a priority of keeping the comments up-to-date when the code changes!
'''

'''
Ensure that your comments are clear and easily understandable to other speakers of the language you are writing in.

'''
An inline comment is a comment on the same line as a statement. Inline comments should be separated by at least two spaces from the statement. They should start with a # and a single space.

# Inline comments are unnecessary and in fact distracting if they state the obvious.
